# Communication
Communication repository for @unball


##Building the communication node

1. If it's your first time running this code, and you use ubuntu, please run `sh fix.sh` (your arduino must be plugged in)

2. If you don't have installed rosserial and joy, follow this steps:
	
	* run `sudo apt-get install ros-<rosdistro>-rosserial-arduino`
	* run `sudo apt-get install ros-<rosdistro>-rosserial`
	* run `sudo apt-get install ros-<rosdistro>-joy`


3. Make a link on your [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)


##Running

Run `roslaunch communication run_communication.launch`


##Launching the whole program with the joystick


`cd Communication`

* Terminal 1: `sudo xboxdrv --silent`
* Terminal 2: `roslaunch communication run_joystick.launch`
* Terminal 3: `python control/position_control.py`
* Terminal 4: `python control/differential_model.py`
* Terminal 5: Â `python control/speed_converter.py`
* Terminal 6: `roslaunch communication run_communication.launch`
* Terminal 7: `rostopic echo /joy`
* Terminal 8: `rostopic echo /target_positions_topic`
* Terminal 9: `rostopic echo /robots_speeds`
* Terminal 10: `rostopic echo /wheels_speeds`
* Terminal 11: `rostopic echo /radio_topic`

##Sending speeds with terminal

After open the Terminal 4
* Run `python dummy_publisher/dummy_pub.py`

Select option 8 and after that insert the motor speeds. Their need to be a list with 3 speeds ([Robot1, Robot2, Robot3])
